    "I carefully inspected the features to understand the data. Initial analysis suggests there are many data missing. It was apparent a thorough cleanup was necessary. The steps taken for data cleaning and scrubbing are included in the text of the Jupyter notebooks. Number of viable datapoints after cleaning was too low. After discussions with Jesse Numan one way to get missing data is to web scrape for IMDBpro.org, which is a universal repository for movie industry. He was able to device a script to obtain relatively complete dataset of over 14000 records. Therefore, I chose to develop my data analysis around this much more complete dataset. The data source and alterations are mentioned in the Jupyter notebook. Staring from the scrapped dataset other information such as runtime, rating , actors and writers were grabbed from the provided datafiles. Following are the list of scrapped datafiles \n",

The notebook is ordered such chat each files is loaded, explored and cleaned in units of code. The comments are given on each cell where it is appropriate to do so. Joining of different data frames into one single data frame is done at the end of the notebook. All sections contain subtitles that clearly explains the purpose. \n",
    "In most places where data is missing (‘NaN’) a dummy values ( -1.0 or ‘unknown’ ) is created in hopes to get the data by other means later or not to lose too many useful data. Some features such as “death year” of a director or actor is dropped entirely. \n",

    "“Binary genres” : The genre for a movie is given as one, two, three or even more primitive genres such as action, family, Sci-Fi… etc. Such situation makes the analysis quite tedious and unclear. As a crude alternative only the 1st two primitive genres are kept for those with more than two and single valued ones are kept untouched. I’ve coined the term “binary genre” for this feature to signify it contains two primitive genres. \n",
